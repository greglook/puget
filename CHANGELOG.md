## [Unreleased]

...


## [1.3.4] - 2022-11-09

### Fixed
- Add backwards-compatibility support for Clojure 1.7 and 1.8.


## [1.3.3] - 2022-11-07

### Changed
- Update to Clojure 1.11.
- Update the arrangement and fipp dependencies.
  [#58](https://github.com/greglook/puget/pull/58)


## [1.3.2] - 2021-12-11

This is a maintenance release which updates several dependency versions,
renames `master` to `main`, and modernizes the CI and build tooling.


## [1.3.1] - 2020-06-01

### Added
- `java.time.Instant` is automatically rendered as an `#inst` tagged literal.


## [1.3.0] - 2020-05-19

### Added
- New configuration option `:coll-limit` adds support for truncating all
  collections after a certain size. This applies to sequences as well, though
  `:seq-limit` still takes precedence if set.
  [#50](//github.com/greglook/puget/issues/50)
  [#52](//github.com/greglook/puget/pull/52)


## [1.2.1] - 2020-04-19

### Changed
- Minor version upgrades


## [1.2.0] - 2019-10-11

### Fixed
- Ansi codes now respect indentation and start at beginning of element rather
  than beginning of line.
  [#44](//github.com/greglook/puget/issues/44)

### Changed
- Update CI configuration to support style checks and separate coverage check.
- Switch to cljdoc for documentation.


## [1.1.2] - 2019-04-04

### Fixed
- The `:html-inline` color markup now properly handles nested documents in
  `color/document` calls.
- The `:html-inline` color markup now defaults to assuming a style value is a
  color, allowing use of any CSS color name.


## [1.1.1] - 2019-03-17

### Changed
- Upgrade to clojure 1.10.0.
- Upgrade to clj-arrangement 1.2.0 for a ~3x speedup when sorting complex
  collections for canonical printing.


## [1.1.0] - 2018-12-16

### Added
- The pretty-printer supports a `:namespace-maps` option which will render maps
  using the new namespace map literal syntax introduced in Clojure 1.9.0 when
  possible.
  [#36](//github.com/greglook/puget/issues/36)

### Changed
- Collections which are `sorted?` are no longer reordered by the pretty-printer.
  [#37](//github.com/greglook/puget/issues/37)
- Empty collections now omit child document nodes, so they are slightly more
  efficient to render.


## [1.0.3] - 2018-10-30

### Changed
- Upgrade to fipp 0.6.13 for Java 11 compatibility.
  [#38](//github.com/greglook/puget/pull/38)

### Changed
- Upgrade to CircleCI 2.0
- Upgrade various minor dependency versions


## [1.0.1] - 2016-08-23

### Added
- Add checks to `printer/tagged-handler` to ensure argumenst are a symbol and
  function, respectively.

### Changed

- Add print handlers for class and function values.

### Changed

  print-handler approach.

## [0.8.1] - 2015-04-25

## [0.8.0] - 2015-03-10
