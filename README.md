Puget is a Clojure library for printing [EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn)
values. Under the hood, Puget formats data into a _print document_ and uses the
[Fast Idiomatic Pretty-Printer](https://github.com/brandonbloom/fipp) library to
render it. Puget offers two main features which set it apart from FIPP and
Clojure's native pretty-printing functions: [syntax coloring](#syntax-coloring)
and [canonical printing](#canonical-representation).

## Installation

Puget releases are [published on Clojars](https://clojars.org/mvxcvi/puget).

To use this version with Leiningen, add the following dependency to your project
definition:

```clojure
[mvxcvi/puget "0.6.2"]
```

See [Whidbey](https://github.com/greglook/whidbey) for nREPL and Leiningen integration.

## Syntax Coloring

Puget's first main feature is colorizing the printed data using ANSI escape
codes. This is kind of like syntax highlighting, except much easier since the
code works directly with the data instead of parsing it from text.

Different syntax elements are given different colors to make reading the
printed output much easier for humans. The `:print-color` option can be set to
enable colorization using the `with-color` macro - alternately, the `cprint`
function prints with colored output enabled:

## Canonical Representation

Puget's other main goal is to provide _canonical serialization_ of data. In
short, if two data values are equal, they should be printed identically. This is
important for data deduplication and in situations where the printed data is
hashed.

Towards this end, Puget defines a _total ordering_ on Clojure values, meaning
that it provides a comparator that can provide an ordering for any two values,
even if they have different types. This ordering is used to sort the values in
sets and the keys in maps so that they are always printed the same way.

By default, values with types which have no canonical representation defined
will be printed in the same style as Clojure's pretty-print. The `:strict-mode`
option can be set to true to throw an exception for these values instead.

```clojure
(require '[puget.printer :as puget])

(def usd (java.util.Currency/getInstance "USD"))

(puget/pprint usd)
;; #<java.util.Currency USD>

(puget/with-options {:strict true}
  (puget/pprint usd))
;; IllegalArgumentException: No canonical representation for class java.util.Currency: USD
```

## EDN Tagged Values

All of Clojure's primitive types are given their standard canonical print
representations. To handle non-standard data types, EDN specifies _tags_ which
can alter how the reader interprets the following value. Accordingly, Puget
provides a `TaggedValue` protocol in the `puget.data` namespace. This lets novel
datatypes provide a 'canonical' representation of themselves as a tag symbol
followed by some interpretation of the value.

Puget extends this protocol to support the `#inst` and `#uuid` built-ins from
the EDN standard. In addition, it supports `#bin` for base64-encoded binary
data, and `#uri` for specifying Uniform Resource Identifiers.

To give your own types a tag extension, use the `extend-tagged-*` functions. For
example, to extend `#inst` tagging to Joda `DateTime` objects:

```clojure
(require '(clj-time [core :as t] [format :as f]))

(t/now)
#<org.joda.time.DateTime 2014-05-14T00:58:40.922Z>

(require 'puget.data)

(puget.data/extend-tagged-value
  org.joda.time.DateTime 'inst
  (partial f/unparse (ftime/formatters :date-time)))

(t/now)
#inst "2014-05-14T01:05:53.885Z"
```

## Further Customization

Puget's printing is controlled by a map of options in the dynamic var
`puget.printer/*options*`. This can be bound with the `with-options` macro for
convenience. The options include print width, whether Puget is being strict,
whether to print metadata, etc.

Puget's colors are defined by the `:color-scheme` key, which maps syntax element
keywords to a vector of ANSI style keywords to apply.  The `set-color-scheme!`
function offers a convenient way to change the colors by providing either
color/style argument pairs or a single map of colors to merge into the current
color scheme.

```clojure
(puget/set-color-scheme! :nil [:bold :black])
{:boolean [:green]
 :class-delimiter [:blue]
 :class-name [:bold :blue]
 :delimiter [:bold :red]
 :function-symbol [:bold :blue]
 :keyword [:bold :yellow]
 :nil [:bold :black]
 :number [:cyan]
 :string [:bold :magenta]
 :character [:bold :magenta]
 :symbol nil
 :tag [:red]}
```
